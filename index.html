Later, he finds out that one of his other cups is replaced with the shattered cup.
			<br>
			<h4>Ch 6-7: Rain Furnace</h4>
			Marisa wonders if her family’s past relationship with Rinnosuke is what’s causing him to be cold towards her.

Unbeknownst to Marisa, her collection contained a sword made of the same rare metal, a fact that Rinnosuke hides from her and ends up adopting a stiff attitude towards her.

			<h3>Imperishable Night (Main game 8)</h3>
			During the night of the full moon, Eirin casts a spell encasing Gensokyo under a different sky where the moon is swapped out for a fake one, out of fear that emissaries from the Moon would come for Kaguya.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 8-9: Summer Drizzle Hall</h4>
			Reimu is tasked with investigating an incident involving non-stop rain that has been falling only near Rinnosuke’s shop for several days.

			<br>
			<h4>Ch 10: The Flowers of Muenzuka Higan</h4>
			Rinnosuke visits Muenzuka and finds a bone of a human right arm that didn’t fit any of the other cremated remains. When he visits again the next day, he mysteriously finds another bone that’s identical to the one he found before.

			<br>
			<h4>Ch 12: The Deities’ Tool</h4>
			A mysterious box-like item with buttons and a screen ends up in Rinnosuke’s possession, which deeply alarms Rinnosuke as it manifests to him as something that can manipulate people and various creatures, start wars, and the like. When he receives a message from Yukari saying that she wants it, he tries to destroy it preemptively, but Yukari stops him from doing so using a gap.

		<div class="cola elem">
			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 13: Phantasmal Light & Snow on the Window</h4>
			Youmu comes to Rinnosuke’s shop to retrieve the Soul Torch, the tool that gave her power to control ghosts, having angered Yuyuko for having lost it and hiding it from her. Since Yuyuko herself activated the Soul Torch so that Youmu could find it (and causing ghosts to cluster in the shop and making the interior bitterly cold), Rinnosuke deduces that he had been used to teach Youmu a lesson, and makes Youmu clean up snow on the roof as payment.
			<br>
			<h4>Ch 14: Colorless Sakura</h4>
			Day by day, the cherry blossoms outside Rinnosuke’s shop get more and more splendid, but on the last day, the cherry blossoms there bloom to the point of unnaturalness in pure-white flowers.

		</div>

		<div class="cola elem">
			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 15: A Nameless Stone</h4>
			The limits of Rinnosuke’s ability to perceive the names of objects are made apparent when Reimu brings in a large piece of fossil-like stone that even he is unable to identify, although he chalks it up to the existence of a still-living “Dragon” entity. Rinnosuke launches into a lecture on how the gods themselves are the ones who have provided names to things, and anything that existed prior to that should never be confined to such a whimsical definition as “fossil.”

			<br>
			<h4>Ch 22: The Universe the Youkai Saw</h4>
			Some years ago, Rinnosuke came across an old armillary sphere, which ended up starting an annual meteor shower viewing with the girls. Because the constellations written on it had youkai names, it was a youkai armillary sphere. In the present day, Rinnosuke discovers that Yukari was the one who named the constellations, and that the legend of youkai going to the Moon a thousand years ago is true.

			<h4>Monologue</h4>
			Akyuu reflects on how her current incarnation oversaw drastic change within Gensokyo as the walling-off from the Outside changed the human-youkai dynamic. She observes that the Gensokyo Chronicles has changed from being a guide for humans to defend against youkai to being a guide for youkai to teach humans about themselves, and wonders if there is any need for her reincarnations (that have preserved her perfect-memory ability across nine generations as a chronicler) to continue.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 23: The Contagious God</h4>
			Rinnosuke, who is being visited by a sick Marisa, is visited by a sick Reimu who performs a sealing ritual on a nameless item fragment in the shop. Apparently, Marisa had let loose a "contagious god" by peeling off the seals on a plate she found at Muenzuka, and what Reimu had to do was bind the contagious god's agency (role?) to a forgotten human spirit, who is apparently bored enough to take on the job, and who will gather faith in the contagious god's capacity when Reimu shows it to affected individuals, curing them in the process.

			<h3>Touhou Sangetsusei: Strange and Bright Nature Deity</h3>
			<h4>Ch 5-6: Witches and Lies</h4>

Meanwhile, the fairies, who have become unwilling guests in Alice’s house during a treasure-hunting excursion, are telling bad lies to a suspicious Alice to avoid getting into an even worse situation when they are suddenly attacked by bullfinches, sparing them from the dollmaker’s aggression.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 24: The Charming Moon</h4>
			With the cherry blossoms being late to bloom, Rinnosuke thinks back to Yukari’s account that they are actually blooming earlier in the Outside, where winter has become warmer. While March is an early time for cherry blossoms to bloom, Rinnosuke teaches the girls about the lunar calendar, a discontinued system at odds with the four seasons that is more in tune with the needs of youkai, and one where the third month is in fact the time for cherry blossoms.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 25: The Blessings of the Shrine</h4>
			With the Hakurei Shrine owing its lack of faith to the presence of youkai, Rinnosuke suggests switching out its current god for a more popular one among humans. Reimu proposes a god with more tangible blessings, such as a god of sake, and Rinnosuke explains how to make the most out of a god’s blessings, with the premise that a god manifests as an object’s two opposing personalities.

		<div class="sangetsusei elem">
			<h3>Touhou Sangetsusei: Strange and Bright Nature Deity</h3>
			<h4>Ch 9-10: The Delicate Kirisame</h4>
			The fairies are blocked from entering their home, which is overgrown with seemingly unbreakable vines. Suspecting that it is a youkai's doing, they seek help from Alice, who turns them down but directs them to Marisa's house. Marisa runs out of ideas herself, but when Star Sapphire serves a tasty-looking dinner, they are attacked by the vines and can only watch as a strange-looking creature devours the food. Reimu explains that tsuchinoko are servants of the god of plants, and that all that they are known for are eating and sleeping.

Marisa reveals that the glow only happens when the moss is illuminated by reflected sunlight, and when Sunny illuminates it with her power, tricks the fairies into thinking that they have just disturbed the great Xuanwu himself.

		<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
		<h4>Ch 27: Mechanism of Fortune</h4>
		Every sixty years, an influx of ghosts appear in Gensokyo, a phenomenon that Rinnosuke chalks up to the inevitable repeating of history. Reimu, having arrived after a ghost-catching session with Marisa, claims that her uncanny fortune during Chinchirorin (a dice-rolling game) is thanks to her being able to "feel" the dice. Reimu explains that there are three layers in this world: physical, mental, and memory - as she previously learned from Akyuu, someone who holds generations of memories. She deduces that it is therefore impossible for history to repeat itself as long as the memory layer keeps growing, and that memory determines probability and is the distinguishing factor between the fortunate and the unfortunate.

	The youkai rabbit, actually a fugitive from the Moon, escapes and asks Eirin to take her in, having grown tired of atoning for the sin of Chang’e (by pounding the Elixir), a prisoner of the Moon, but Eirin turns her down, since the fugitive rabbit’s usage of the Lunar Veil is taken to be evidence that she still has attachment to the Moon. When Eirin is asked if she is the leader on Earth who is fomenting a rebellion against the Moon, as rumored, she flatly denies and instead gives the rabbit a letter to be delivered to a certain “Miss Watatsuki,” the leader of the guardian forces on the Moon, that will supposedly explain her side of the story.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 3: The Scarlet Rocket</h4>
	One month ago, Ran had asked the Scarlet Devil crew for assistance in Yukari’s plan to seize a “limitless energy” that powers the Moon, something Yukari had already attempted hundreds of years ago to result in failure. In the present, Remilia has decided to surprise Yukari by going to the Moon first herself via the rocket being assembled in Patchouli's library.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 4: Our Old Friend, the Rainy Moon</h4>
	During the night of the autumn harvest moon, the Netherworld duo think back to two months prior when Yuyuko declined Ran's request to keep an eye on Remilia, on the basis that there was no way the Scarlet Devil crew could ever achieve their goal. Back in the present, Yuyuko expresses her belief that Ran herself does not understand Yukari’s intentions, and tells Youmu to inform Reimu that the power of the gods is the key to getting to the Moon. A confused Youmu sees this as aiding and abetting Remilia, as this info will likely pass onto Sakuya.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 5: The Sumiyoshi Project</h4>
	Sakuya arrives at the shrine to ask about a “three-staged outer shell” hoping to find a way to power Remilia's rocket, and Youmu also joins in to suggest invoking the power to “calm the sea.” The gang then turn their attention to Sumiyoshi, a conglomeration of three gods that make up the god of voyages. Back at the mansion, Patchouli and Sakuya decide to accommodate Reimu, the de facto power source, so she can become a vessel for the gods. The expedition is dubbed “Project Sumiyoshi.”
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 6: The Three-God Moon Rocket</h4>
	Reimu practices channeling all three Sumiyoshi gods at once while Patchouli patches the Scarlet Devil crew’s rocket to accommodate Reimu's needs. Yukari is revealed to be observing everything all this time through a crow familiar. She ponders about using the rocket to reach the dark side of the Moon, and sends her familiar to the Moon, where it catches a glimpse of the opulent Lunar Capital before the vision dissolves and it succumbs to the harsh environment of space.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 7: The Princesses of the Moon</h4>
	At the Lunar Capital, the Watatsuki sisters punish the fugitive rabbit by making her their pet and naming her after their former pet, Reisen. Upon receiving Eirin's letter, they speak fondly of Eirin as their former teacher before opening the letter.

	<h3>Touhou Sangetsusei: Strange and Bright Nature Deity</h3>
	<h4>Vol 1 Ex: Make it Three Drinks</h4>
	Over drinks, the fairies complain about being sidelined throughout the previous incidents. Despite not having enough power to cause an incident of their own, they decide to scout for one to partake in to fulfill their ambition. Some time later, they head for Hakurei Shrine, where a new god (probably Kanako) is living.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 15-16: The God and the Devil of the Sky</h4>
	The fairies lie in wait at the shrine during New Year’s Eve to prank on unsuspecting worshippers, but no one comes. Remilia seeks a suitable alcoholic beverage to go with her hot soba, and Sakuya returns with soba sochu. Reimu performs a ritual to ensure that the sun does not lose to the morning star at daytime (the opposite of which would indicate that the coming year will be advantageous to the youkai). The next morning, the morning star indeed shines prominently, to Reimu’s dismay, but it is revealed that it is due to the fairies pulling a prank from the sky.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 17-18: The Worm inside the Jar, the Vine Worm’s Vase</h4>
	The fairies steal a large jug of “secret sake” from Reimu, who had gotten it from Suika. They drink it, but it appears to be merely water. Eirin informs them that there are tiny “wine worms” in the liquid that eliminate their host’s ability to enjoy alcohol and get drunk. She treats their condition at Eientei and demands payment, seizing the jug since they had no money to offer. The next morning, Eirin smashes the jug and reveals to Reisen and Kaguya that a wine worm is actually a pet-sized creature created by the oni that produces high-grade sake from water. At the shrine, Suika joins Reimu and Marisa and the group is disappointed that the sake is not as good as they had expected (The fairies swapped the real thing with a jug of normal sake).

	<h3>Scarlet Weather Rhapsody (Main game 10.5)</h3>
	Bored of life in Heaven, Tenshi uses her Sword of Hisou to gather temperaments from the denizens of Gensokyo, resulting in abnormal weather localized to each affected person. The gathered energy manifests as scarlet clouds on top of Youkai Mountain, a salient earthquake omen. A localized earthquake has already destroyed Hakurei Shrine, which prompts Reimu to make Tenshi rebuild it after battling her at Bhavaagra, the celestial also installing a keystone at the shrine to stave off any immediate earthquakes. Yukari notices that Tenshi is rebuilding the shrine in a way that suits her own purposes and destroys it again, at which point Suika offers to lead the rebuild effort. She pranks Tenshi by inviting everyone to Heaven (a portion of which she had begun leasing) for the “celestial torture-fest” disguised as the “groundbreaking ceremony party.”

	<h4>Ch 8: The Sage's Letter</h4>
	The Watatsuki sisters determine that Eirin is the only one they can trust, with her letter telling them about the necessary precautions they must take to protect the Moon. At the same time, Eirin, along with Reisen, sneaks into Patchouli's library and attaches a charm to the rocket that will guarantee its reaching the Moon safely.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 9: Sumiyoshi in Blue</h4>
	Winter hits, and Remilia hosts a party at the mansion to celebrate the completion of the rocket. When Remilia appeals to the crowd to name the three stages, Eirin names them after the three stars in Orion’s Belt, the same stars that represent Sumiyoshi. Yuyuko leaves the party early with Youmu and tells her that Eirin is actually a spy.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 10: Illusionary Cape Canaveral</h4>
	Remilia, Sakuya, Reimu, and Marisa board the rocket, with Patchouli watching the liftoff from below. Also witnessing the launch are the Eientei crew from their home, Eirin revealing that the charm she attached to the rocket was actually a fragment of the Lunar Veil. She explains that her reasoning for wanting the vampire crew to succeed is so that she wants to get to the “real culprit” behind the planned Lunar invasion, purportedly Yukari.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 11: Flying the Blue Sky</h4>
	Eirin and Kaguya visit Patchouli to learn the status of the mission and discover that Patchouli already knows about all the outside manipulation surrounding the mission, including the Lunar Veil fragment. She admits that the reason she did not partake in the journey herself is that she “hates getting into trouble.” Twelve days after launch, the module crash-lands into an ocean on the Moon.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 12: The Sea of Prosperity</h4>
	The rocket is obliterated and the crew is dispersed along a beach at Mare Tranquillitatis where all they can find are peach trees. An army of Moon rabbits arrive but are scared off by Remilia and Sakuya, while Yorihime captures Reimu and Marisa. Sakuya subdues Yorihime and Remilia professes that the reason they came is to take over the Moon.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 13: The Beauty of the Moon's Surface</h4>
	Yorihime's ability is revealed to be a stronger version of Reimu's - the ability to channel the power of various gods. Marisa introduces the spell card battle rules to Yorihime as a way to fight while minimizing bloodshed and promises to go back to Earth immediately if they lose to her. Remilia orders Sakuya to fight Yorihime.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 14: The Metal Showdown</h4>
	According to Eirin's letter, the group that Yorihime is facing is a decoy. Nevertheless, they battle, and Yorihime handedly defeats Sakuya. Remilia orders Marisa to fight her next.

	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 16: A Map from an Old Friend</h4>
	Yukari and Ran fly over a Lunar mare as Yuyuko and Youmu go through Yukari's portal inside the Moon's reflection on Misty Lake, ending up at a Lunar mare. Yuyuko deduces that there is a favor Yukari has requested from her. Meanwhile, Remilia suffers a heavy defeat.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 17: The 27-1/3 Trap</h4>
	Reimu borrows the power of impurity from a god to use against Yorihime. At Mare Ingenii, Yukari reveals that the mission all along has been to steal whatever treasure they can get their hands on from the house of the “Lunar Sage.” They open a portal to enter, but are transported to the Bamboo Forest back in Gensokyo where they are confronted by Toyohime and Reisen (of the Moon). Eirin had set a trap many years ago by tweaking the duration of the Moon’s orbital period (and hence the Full Moon that’s allowing them to travel freely thus far).
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 18: The Lunar Mastermind</h4>
	Yorihime summons a god to purify Reimu’s impurity. Toyohime brandishes a fan that can “instantly purify this forest at the atomic level,” leading to Yukari’s instant surrender. Yukari humbly requests that she spare the other living creatures on Earth and punish her only.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 19: The Bound God of the Great Earth</h4>
	As she is being restrained, Yukari ponders the concept of shimenawa. Toyohime receives a message that the intruders on the Moon have also been defeated and sends a letter to Eirin to notify her of her and Yorihime’s success. Eirin tells Kaguya that rather than the Lunar Capital, she cares more about the competence of her successors. Back on the Moon, Yuyuko and Youmu come across a glove that Yukari left hanging from a portal earlier.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 20: That Final Trace of Impurity</h4>
	25 days after departure, Reimu is the last to make it back to Gensokyo out of everyone in the rocket crew. According to rumors on the Moon, the one behind the rebellion can call on the gods. To vindicate herself, Yorihime had made Reimu stay for a while to demonstrate her abilities throughout the Lunar Capital. While Reimu is doing so, Yuyuko is shown to have mysteriously appeared among the Moon rabbits.
	<br><br>
	<h4>Ch 21: The Blue Feast</h4>
	Yukari and Ran are let go from the Moon and return to Gensokyo, at which point Yukari immediately celebrates her "victory." It turns out she herself and the vampire crew were both decoys for the real intruders, Yuyuko and Youmu, who gained access to the Watatsuki sisters' home while they were busy. At Hakugyokurou, Yuyuko reveals that the treasure she stole is a thousand-year-old bottle of sake. Over at the mansion, the vampire crew had constructed a pool in the library to indulge in the ocean experience they encountered on the Moon, and had invited Reimu and Marisa to join in as an apology for the trouble they went through. Yukari and Yuyuko also join in to share their sake with everyone.
