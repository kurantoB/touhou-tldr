<h5>Ch 13: Phantasmal Light & Snow on the Window</h5>
Youmu comes to Rinnosuke’s shop to retrieve the Soul Torch, the tool that gave her power to control ghosts, having angered Yuyuko for having lost it and hiding it from her. Since Yuyuko herself activated the Soul Torch so that Youmu could find it (and causing ghosts to cluster in the shop and making the interior bitterly cold), Rinnosuke deduces that he had been used to teach Youmu a lesson, and makes Youmu clean up snow on the roof as payment.
<br>
<h5>Ch 14: Colorless Sakura</h5>
Day by day, the cherry blossoms outside Rinnosuke’s shop get more and more splendid, but on the last day, the cherry blossoms there bloom to the point of unnaturalness in pure-white flowers.

<h4>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h4>
<h5>Ch 15: A Nameless Stone</h5>
The limits of Rinnosuke’s ability to perceive the names of objects are made apparent when Reimu brings in a large piece of fossil-like stone that even he is unable to identify, although he chalks it up to the existence of a still-living “Dragon” entity. Rinnosuke launches into a lecture on how the gods themselves are the ones who have provided names to things, and anything that existed prior to that should never be confined to a such a whimsical definition as “fossil.”

<h5>Monologue</h5>
Akyuu reflects on how her current incarnation oversaw drastic change within Gensokyo as the walling-off from the Outside changed the human-youkai dynamic. She observes that the Gensokyo Chronicles has changed from being a guide for humans to defend against youkai to being a guide for youkai to teach humans about themselves, and wonders if there is any need for her reincarnations (that have preserved her perfect-memory ability across nine generations as a chronicler) to continue.

<h4>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h4>
<h5>Ch 23: The Contagious God</h5>
Rinnosuke, who is being visited by a sick Marisa, is visited by a sick Reimu who performs a sealing ritual on a nameless item fragment in the shop. Apparently, Marisa had let loose a "contagious god" by peeling off the seals on a plate she found at Muenzuka, and what Reimu had to do was bind the contagious god's agency (role?) to a forgotten human spirit, who is apparently bored enough to take on the job, and who will gather faith in the contagious god's capacity when Reimu shows it to affected individuals, curing them in the process.
