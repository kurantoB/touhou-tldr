Later, he finds out that one of his other cups is replaced with the shattered cup.
			<br>
			<h4>Ch 6-7: Rain Furnace</h4>
			Marisa wonders if her family’s past relationship with Rinnosuke is what’s causing him to be cold towards her. Rinnosuke takes up Marisa’s request to forge a new mini-hakkero out of a rare and expensive metal for her, and convinces her to offer up her entire scrap metal collection as payment. Unbeknownst to Marisa, her collection contained a sword made of the same rare metal, a fact that Rinnosuke hides from her and ends up adopting a stiff attitude towards her.

			<h3>Imperishable Night (Main game 8)</h3>
			During the night of the full moon, Eirin casts a spell encasing Gensokyo under a different sky where the moon is swapped out for a fake one, out of fear that emissaries from the Moon would come for Kaguya.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 8-9: Summer Drizzle Hall</h4>
			Reimu is tasked with investigating an incident involving non-stop rain that has been falling only near Rinnosuke’s shop for several days. Rinnosuke believes the incident to be a good omen from the heavens for him procuring the legendary sword (from the previous chapter), but Reimu reveals that it was due to a rain fairy hiding in the attic.
			<br>
			<h4>Ch 10: The Flowers of Muenzuka Higan</h4>
			Rinnosuke visits Muenzuka and finds a bone of a human right arm that didn’t fit any of the other cremated remains. When he visits again the next day, he mysteriously finds another bone that’s identical to the one he found before.

			<br>
			<h4>Ch 12: The Deities’ Tool</h4>
			A mysterious box-like item with buttons and a screen ends up in Rinnosuke’s possession, which deeply alarms Rinnosuke as it manifests to him as something that can manipulate people and various creatures, start wars, and the like. When he receives a message from Yukari saying that she wants it, he tries to destroy it preemptively, but Yukari stops him from doing so using a gap.

		<div class="cola elem">
			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 13: Phantasmal Light & Snow on the Window</h4>
			Youmu comes to Rinnosuke’s shop to retrieve the Soul Torch, the tool that gave her power to control ghosts, having angered Yuyuko for having lost it and hiding it from her. Since Yuyuko herself activated the Soul Torch so that Youmu could find it (and causing ghosts to cluster in the shop and making the interior bitterly cold), Rinnosuke deduces that he had been used to teach Youmu a lesson, and makes Youmu clean up snow on the roof as payment.
			<br>
			<h4>Ch 14: Colorless Sakura</h4>
			Day by day, the cherry blossoms outside Rinnosuke’s shop get more and more splendid, but on the last day, the cherry blossoms there bloom to the point of unnaturalness in pure-white flowers. When Reimu shows up for the first “true flower-viewing” at the shop, Rinnosuke ponders the significance of a pure-white force attracting a red-white entity.

		</div>

		<div class="cola elem">
			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 15: A Nameless Stone</h4>
			The limits of Rinnosuke’s ability to perceive the names of objects are made apparent when Reimu brings in a large piece of fossil-like stone that even he is unable to identify, although he chalks it up to the existence of a still-living “Dragon” entity. Rinnosuke launches into a lecture on how the gods themselves are the ones who have provided names to things, and anything that existed prior to that should never be confined to such a whimsical definition as “fossil.”

			<br>
			<h4>Ch 22: The Universe the Youkai Saw</h4>
			Some years ago, Rinnosuke came across an old armillary sphere, which ended up starting an annual meteor shower viewing with the girls. Because the constellations written on it had youkai names, it was a youkai armillary sphere. In the present day, Rinnosuke discovers that Yukari was the one who named the constellations, and that the legend of youkai going to the Moon a thousand years ago is true.

			<br>
			<h4>Monologue</h4>
			Akyuu reflects on how her current incarnation oversaw drastic change within Gensokyo as the walling-off from the Outside changed the human-youkai dynamic. She observes that the Gensokyo Chronicles has changed from being a guide for humans to defend against youkai to being a guide for youkai to teach humans about themselves, and wonders if there is any need for her reincarnations (that have preserved her perfect-memory ability across nine generations as a chronicler) to continue.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 23: The Contagious God</h4>
			Rinnosuke, who is being visited by a sick Marisa, is visited by a sick Reimu who performs a sealing ritual on a nameless item fragment in the shop. Apparently, Marisa had let loose a "contagious god" by peeling off the seals on a plate she found at Muenzuka, and what Reimu had to do was bind the contagious god's agency (role?) to a forgotten human spirit, who is apparently bored enough to take on the job, and who will gather faith in the contagious god's capacity when Reimu shows it to affected individuals, curing them in the process.

		<div class="sangetsusei elem">
			<h3>Touhou Sangetsusei: Strange and Bright Nature Deity</h3>
			<h4>Ch 5-6: Witches and Lies</h4>
			In hopes of attracting visitors to her shrine, Reimu performs a “bullfinch exchange” ritual in which bullfinches are summoned with a whistle and bestowed the task of attacking liars to cleanse them of their lies, much to Marisa’s detriment. Meanwhile, the fairies, who have become unwilling guests in Alice’s house during a treasure-hunting excursion, are telling bad lies to a suspicious Alice to avoid getting into an even worse situation when they are suddenly attacked by bullfinches, sparing them from the dollmaker’s aggression.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 24: The Charming Moon</h4>
			With the cherry blossoms being late to bloom, Rinnosuke thinks back to Yukari’s account that they are actually blooming earlier in the Outside, where winter has become warmer. While March is an early time for cherry blossoms to bloom, Rinnosuke teaches the girls about the lunar calendar, a discontinued system at odds with the four seasons that is more in tune with the needs of youkai, and one where the third month is in fact the time for cherry blossoms.

			<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
			<h4>Ch 25: The Blessings of the Shrine</h4>
			With the Hakurei Shrine owing its lack of faith to the presence of youkai, Rinnosuke suggests switching out its current god for a more popular one among humans. Reimu proposes a god with more tangible blessings, such as a god of sake, and Rinnosuke explains how to make the most out of a god’s blessings, with the premise that a god manifests as an object’s two opposing personalities.
		</div>

		<div class="sangetsusei elem">
			<h3>Touhou Sangetsusei: Strange and Bright Nature Deity</h3>
			<h4>Ch 9-10: The Delicate Kirisame</h4>
			The fairies are blocked from entering their home, which is overgrown with seemingly unbreakable vines. Suspecting that it is a youkai's doing, they seek help from Alice, who turns them down but directs them to Marisa's house. Marisa runs out of ideas herself, but when Star Sapphire serves a tasty-looking dinner, they are attacked by the vines and can only watch as a strange-looking creature devours the food. Reimu explains that tsuchinoko are servants of the god of plants, and that all that they are known for are eating and sleeping.

		Marisa claims to have seen a mysterious moss at Xuanwu’s Ravine that glows in the dark. Overhearing her conversation with Reimu, the three fairies go exploring out of curiosity. Marisa reveals that the glow only happens when the moss is illuminated by reflected sunlight, and when Sunny illuminates it with her power, tricks the fairies into thinking that they have just disturbed the great Xuanwu himself.

		<h3>Curiosities of Lotus Asia</h3>
		<h4>Ch 27: Mechanism of Fortune</h4>
		Every sixty years, an influx of ghosts appear in Gensokyo, a phenomenon that Rinnosuke chalks up to the inevitable repeating of history. Reimu, having arrived after a ghost-catching session with Marisa, claims that her uncanny fortune during Chinchirorin (a dice-rolling game) is thanks to her being able to "feel" the dice. Reimu explains that there are three layers in this world: physical, mental, and memory - as she previously learned from Akyuu, someone who holds generations of memories. She deduces that it is therefore impossible for history to repeat itself as long as the memory layer keeps growing, and that memory determines probability and is the distinguishing factor between the fortunate and the unfortunate.

When Reimu is examining her apple tree with Marisa, they attempt to steal a carp from her house by having Cirno freeze it, but the shenanigan falls flat when Cirno encases it in an ice ball that is too big.

	The youkai rabbit, actually a fugitive from the Moon, escapes and asks Eirin to take her in, having grown tired of atoning for the sin of Chang’e (by pounding the Elixir), a prisoner of the Moon, but Eirin turns her down, since the fugitive rabbit’s usage of the Lunar Veil is taken to be evidence that she still has attachment to the Moon. When Eirin is asked if she is the leader on Earth who is fomenting a rebellion against the Moon, as rumored, she flatly denies and instead gives the rabbit a letter to be delivered to a certain “Miss Watatsuki,” the leader of the guardian forces on the Moon, that will supposedly explain her side of the story.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 3: The Scarlet Rocket</h4>
	One month ago, Ran had asked the Scarlet Devil crew for assistance in Yukari’s plan to seize a “limitless energy” that powers the Moon, something Yukari had already attempted hundreds of years ago to result in failure. In the present, Remilia has decided to surprise Yukari by going to the Moon first herself via the rocket being assembled in Patchouli's library.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 4: Our Old Friend, the Rainy Moon</h4>
	During the night of the autumn harvest moon, the Netherworld duo think back to two months prior when Yuyuko declined Ran's request to keep an eye on Remilia, on the basis that there was no way the Scarlet Devil crew could ever achieve their goal. Back in the present, Yuyuko expresses her belief that Ran herself does not understand Yukari’s intentions, and tells Youmu to inform Reimu that the power of the gods is the key to getting to the Moon. A confused Youmu sees this as aiding and abetting Remilia, as this info will likely pass onto Sakuya.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 5: The Sumiyoshi Project</h4>
	Sakuya arrives at the shrine to ask about a “three-staged outer shell” hoping to find a way to power Remilia's rocket, and Youmu also joins in to suggest invoking the power to “calm the sea.” The gang then turn their attention to Sumiyoshi, a conglomeration of three gods that make up the god of voyages. Back at the mansion, Patchouli and Sakuya decide to accommodate Reimu, the de facto power source, so she can become a vessel for the gods. The expedition is dubbed “Project Sumiyoshi.”
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 6: The Three-God Moon Rocket</h4>
	Reimu practices channeling all three Sumiyoshi gods at once while Patchouli patches the Scarlet Devil crew’s rocket to accommodate Reimu's needs. Yukari is revealed to be observing everything all this time through a crow familiar. She ponders about using the rocket to reach the dark side of the Moon, and sends her familiar to the Moon, where it catches a glimpse of the opulent Lunar Capital before the vision dissolves and it succumbs to the harsh environment of space.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 7: The Princesses of the Moon</h4>
	At the Lunar Capital, the Watatsuki sisters punish the fugitive rabbit by making her their pet and naming her after their former pet, Reisen. Upon receiving Eirin's letter, they speak fondly of Eirin as their former teacher before opening the letter.

	<h4>Vol 1 Ex: Make it Three Drinks</h4>
	Over drinks, the fairies complain about being sidelined throughout the previous incidents. Despite not having enough power to cause an incident of their own, they decide to scout for one to partake in to fulfill their ambition. Some time later, they head for Hakurei Shrine, where a new god (probably Kanako) is living.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 15-16: The God and the Devil of the Sky</h4>
	The fairies lie in wait at the shrine during New Year’s Eve to prank on unsuspecting worshippers, but no one comes. Remilia seeks a suitable alcoholic beverage to go with her hot soba, and Sakuya returns with soba sochu. Reimu performs a ritual to ensure that the sun does not lose to the morning star at daytime (the opposite of which would indicate that the coming year will be advantageous to the youkai). The next morning, the morning star indeed shines prominently, to Reimu’s dismay, but it is revealed that it is due to the fairies pulling a prank from the sky.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 17-18: The Worm inside the Jar, the Vine Worm’s Vase</h4>
	The fairies steal a large jug of “secret sake” from Reimu, who had gotten it from Suika. They drink it, but it appears to be merely water. Eirin informs them that there are tiny “wine worms” in the liquid that eliminate their host’s ability to enjoy alcohol and get drunk. She treats their condition at Eientei and demands payment, seizing the jug since they had no money to offer. The next morning, Eirin smashes the jug and reveals to Reisen and Kaguya that a wine worm is actually a pet-sized creature created by the oni that produces high-grade sake from water. At the shrine, Suika joins Reimu and Marisa and the group is disappointed that the sake is not as good as they had expected (The fairies swapped the real thing with a jug of normal sake).

The gathered energy manifests as scarlet clouds on top of Youkai Mountain, a salient earthquake omen. A localized earthquake has already destroyed Hakurei Shrine, which prompts Reimu to make Tenshi rebuild it after battling her at Bhavaagra, the celestial also installing a keystone at the shrine to stave off any immediate earthquakes. Yukari notices that Tenshi is rebuilding the shrine in a way that suits her own purposes and destroys it again, at which point Suika offers to lead the rebuild effort. She pranks Tenshi by inviting everyone to Heaven (a portion of which she had begun leasing) for the “celestial torture-fest” disguised as the “groundbreaking ceremony party.”

	<h4>Ch 10: Illusionary Cape Canaveral</h4>
	Remilia, Sakuya, Reimu, and Marisa board the rocket, with Patchouli watching the liftoff from below. Also witnessing the launch are the Eientei crew from their home, Eirin revealing that the charm she attached to the rocket was actually a fragment of the Lunar Veil. She explains that her reasoning for wanting the vampire crew to succeed is so that she wants to get to the “real culprit” behind the planned Lunar invasion, purportedly Yukari.

	<h4>Ch 11: Flying the Blue Sky</h4>
	Eirin and Kaguya visit Patchouli to learn the status of the mission and discover that Patchouli already knows about all the outside manipulation surrounding the mission, including the Lunar Veil fragment.

The three fairies notice that the forest has grown more and more dense lately. As they make preparations to move permanently into the tree, they are approached by Yukari. Yukari tests them in combat and utterly defeats them, later revealing that she wanted to make sure the future inhabitants of the tree are weak enough to not use the tree to their advantage. Reimu and Marisa theorize on what led to the shrine belonging to both Gensokyo and the Outside while at the same time belonging to neither. The trees surrounding the shrine are revealed to have been deliberately planted to form the border with the Outside. Yukari explains to Reimu and Marisa that when Reimu stopped worshipping the tree, the god that manifested inside of it disappeared. Since the tree was part of the border, a hole in the border was formed, and a different tree from the Outside moved in to take its place. Given enough time, the area around the tree will revert to bring part of Gensokyo because Yukari has "filled the hole with a power that embodies Gensokyo itself." The three fairies, now living in their new home, start pulling pranks on Reimu.

	During the morning of the first day of the year, Sunny has a dream where a group of fairies are banded together to form a formidable force against the humans. After telling Star and Luna about her dream, the three fairies make a resolution to intimidate other fairies into submission to make their fairy army a reality. As part of their plans, they destroy various people’s homes - one of which is Cirno’s - and leave behind a taunting message. Cirno leaves a threatening message of her own at the fairies’ house, then forgets about it shortly after. The fairies mistaken the threat to be coming from the humans and begin training for war.

	<h4>Ch 17: The 27-1/3 Trap</h4>
	Reimu borrows the power of impurity from a god to use against Yorihime. At Mare Ingenii, Yukari reveals that the mission all along has been to steal whatever treasure they can get their hands on from the house of the “Lunar Sage.” They open a portal to enter, but are transported to the Bamboo Forest back in Gensokyo where they are confronted by Toyohime and Reisen (of the Moon). Eirin had set a trap many years ago by tweaking the duration of the Moon’s orbital period (and hence the Full Moon that’s allowing them to travel freely thus far).

At Hakugyokurou, Yuyuko reveals that the treasure she stole is a thousand-year-old bottle of sake. Over at the mansion, the vampire crew had constructed a pool in the library to indulge in the ocean experience they encountered on the Moon, and had invited Reimu and Marisa to join in as an apology for the trouble they went through.

During spring’s end, Reimu and Marisa explore the flowers behind the shrine and discover the fairies sleeping out in the open. Reimu remarks that she has been seeing the fairies more and more often and suspects that they now live in the vicinity. Marisa recalls the tree that they now live in, and as Reimu goes looking for it, says nothing even when she sees it herself. When Reimu gives up, Marisa brings out a bottle that she had found at a miniature shrine inside the shrine, for a toast. The two of them are startled when neither of them know who put the bottle there, and furthermore, the bottle appears to be restocked regularly after it is consumed. Overhearing their conversation, the fairies decide to steal some alcohol for themselves. The next day, the fairies sneak into the shrine to look for it at the miniature shrine but do not see anything there, but as they turn to leave, they glance back and discover that the bottle appeared where there was nothing moments ago. They then make a vow to solve this mystery of the shrine. Later, Reimu and Marisa conclude that the bottles originate from the Outside, and that someone there has been making regular offerings using them.</div>

	After the events of Subterranean Animism, another object was released from the Underworld into Gensokyo: a flying ship dubbed the “Palanquin Ship.” It and its crew, all of whom were followers of Byakuren, had been sealed underground by humans a millennium ago for advocating equality between youkai and humans. Having sought the power of Makai, Byakuren was sealed away within Hokkai, to which the ship is headed. The player boards the ship and, using the fragments of the Soaring Vault they have collected along with the Jeweled Pagoda found by Byakuren’s followers, break the seal on Hokkai and free Byakuren. Byakuren recognizes that the attitude around humans and youkai have changed since she had last set foot on the surface and enlists Kanako and Suwako’s help in repurposing the ship into a youkai-centered Buddhist temple in the Human Village, henceforth known as Myouren Temple. Afterwards, the reason behind the fragments of the Soaring Vault appearing like UFOs is revealed to be due to Nue putting the Seed of Unknown Form into the vault and scattering the pieces.

	<h4>Ch 1: The Sage's Recollections</h4>
	During Reigetsusai, Eirin and Kaguya notice a piece of cloth they recognize as a lunar veil descending towards a place in the east. An injured youkai rabbit has appeared at Reimu's shrine. Eirin is apprehensive about making her hideout's location known to this mysterious newcomer, whom she deduces is a Moon rabbit that descended via the lunar veil earlier in the night. She has previously heard from Reisen about some new force trying to exert itself on the Moon. Reisen brings news that the Lunar Capital is on high alert due to some purported invasion from Earth that is secretly unfolding. Eirin writes a letter to her two former apprentices on the Moon to establish goodwill. A parallel narrative showcases Kaguya and Eirin's backstory of Kaguya committing the crime of drinking the Hourai Elixir and achieving immortality, being expelled from the Lunar Capital as a result, and being helped by Eirin to remain in hiding on Earth when the time to return to the Moon came, with Tewi and Reisen later joining their ranks.
	<br>
	<h4>Ch 2: Gem of Three Thousand Years</h4>
	Two months later, Kaguya recounts how her jealousy of seeing humans and youkai cooperate during the events of Imperishable Night led her to lift her spell of eternity over Eientei. She also remarks at how Eirin had grown to treat the rabbits and other creatures on Earth more as equals than as lesser beings. Kaguya turns her attention to a bonsai plant that she had been caring for to stave off her boredom, a plant called the "udonge" that only grows at the Lunar Capital and the same plant that the Jeweled Branch of Hourai (from her Five Impossible Requests) is associated with. With the impurity of Earth being its only fruit-bearing trigger, it is now due to blossom. Eirin naming Reisen "Udonge" after the plant might be in reference to the moon rabbit being able to "fully blossom" upon encountering Earth's impurity. Kaguya, Eirin, and Reisen discuss the current events surrounding the other Reisen's landing two months prior, and how Sakuya had come to Eientei some time ago looking for fuel to power Remilia's rocket to the Moon. All the while, Kaguya reminisces about how she was discovered, in the form of an infant, by an old couple in a bamboo forest after her exile from the Moon, wondering why she was seen as anything other than a monster. She decides that the couple were being rewarded in gold by the Moon in doing so. She never thought of them as more than tools. On the other hand, Gensokyo is a place without hierarchy, where Kaguya would not stand out even if she came out of hiding.

	<h4>Ch 3: The Dragon King’s Palace in the Pure Land</h4>
	Princess Toyohime watches over the Sea of Tranquility on the Moon, monitoring the situation after the news that the Apollo flag that was planted on the near side of the Moon had vanished. Toyohime and Yorihime fear suspicion being cast onto them due to their job of monitoring Lunar exiles on Earth. Toyohime thinks about how the Lunar Capital was founded by a sage, Tsukuyomi, who fled to the Moon to escape the impurity of Earth, where all life is afflicted by mortality and struggle. Toyohime also recalls a time 1500 years ago where a fisherman from Earth (Mizue no Uranoshimako) appeared in the Sea of Tranquility, atop a turtle. When Uranoshimako was spirited away to the Moon, Toyohime tricked him into thinking he was at the Dragon King's Palace at the bottom of the sea, when he had thought he was at the land of Hourai. Out of curiosity, Toyohime secretly kept him at her mansion at the Moon when he became bedazzled by the splendor of this world, but he eventually longed for home. Fearing that news of the Lunar Capital's existence would be leaked to Earth, Toyohime confessed to Eirin of her deed, to which the sage advised the sisters to return him to Earth 300 years in the future (with the help of cryogenics). Recognizing the human's agony, the sisters commit to either killing or outright ejecting any such newcomers from now on. Eirin had left Uranoshimako a box before he departed, instructing him to open it if life on Earth became unbearable. Uranoshimako opened it without hesitation, instantly aged forward 300 years, and become a living god. The fisherman's tale, upon reaching the ears of Emperor, became a testimony to the "land of Hourai." Back at the present, the sisters are frustrated with the shortcomings of Reisen, a Lunar emissary recruit. Reisen had fled to the Earth after growing tired of pounding mochi, but was afterwards tasked with delivering Eirin's letter to the sisters, which warned them that someone on Earth was plotting against the Moon. The sisters wonder about the more capable previous Reisen, whose impression on Toyohime as someone cowardly and self-centered explained for her fleeing the Lunar Capital before the previous Lunar War. All of a sudden, a crow shikigami is spotted heading towards the Lunar Capital on a reconnaissance mission, and Toyohime dispatches it.

	<h4>Ch 4: The Eternal Flame</h4>
	Mokou, who recognizes Youkai Mountain's volcanic activity for what it is, discusses the mountain with Keine, who divulges that the mountain is home to a diety of eternity by the name of Iwanagahime, who has a younger sister known as Sakuyahime, a water diety. Upon hearing Sakuyahime's name Mokou relives the moment she became immortal 1300 years ago. Kaguya, having caused a disturbance within Mokou's family, had become Mokou's mortal enemy. To spite Kaguya, Mokou set out to steal a jar left behind by Kaguya as a gift being transported to Mount Fuji's summit by a man by the name of Iwakasa, along with his men. Iwakasa allowed her to tag along on the journey, not taking her intentions seriously. He revealed that he intended to cast the jar into the volcanic crater to burn it, but Sakuyahime emerged and warned that destroying the jar, owing to the immense power of its contents, would cause the volcano to erupt in a way that is unstoppable even for Sakuyahime herself. It was then that Iwakasa revealed that the content of the jar was the Hourai Elixir. A parting gift from Kaguya before her return to the Moon, it was rejected by the old couple who raised her, who passed on the opportunity to live forever. The Emperor saw no point in living forever in a world where Kaguya was unattainable and thus ordered for it to be brought to the place closest to the Moon and burnt. By Mount Fuji's crater, Mokou suddenly awakened to all of Iwakasa's men succumbing to a killing spree over the elixir, leaving only herself and Iwakasa alive. (Reflecting on this in the present, Mokou deduces that Sakuyahime herself had killed them off, deliberately sparing the two of them.) Sakuyahime suggests burning the elixir atop another peak, Yatsugatake, instead, which was the domain of the goddess's elder sister Iwanagahime. Iwakasa was confused, as that mountain was much shorter than Mount Fuji, but nevertheless complied. It was during the descent from Mount Fuji's summit when Mokou, enthralled by the idea of immortality, ambushed Iwakasa and drank the elixir. As for how Iwanagahime came to inhabit Yatsugatake, Keine recounts a story of when Yatsugatake was actually a taller mountain than Mount Fuji, which Sakuyahime inhabited. Sakuyahime, whose ego would not stand for it, cleaved Yatsugatake into pieces, rendering it in its current form. Put off by her younger sister's behavior, Iwanagahime deserted Mount Fuji to inhabit Yatsugatake, bringing her power of eternity with her. As such, the eternal flame atop Mount Fuji vanished, and the volcano became dormant. Presently, the same eternal flame now burns on top of Youkai Mountain, which itself is the original form of Yatsugatake. Mokou is apprehensive about Kaguya herself returning to the Moon, leaving Mokou short one immortal companion in the world. She eavesdrops on the Eientei crew from outside and is relieved that Kaguya doesn't seem to have any intention of going back. Finally, Mokou ponders finally climbing Youkai Mountain to meet Iwanagahime and apologize for her deed 1300 years ago.

	<h4>Ch 5: From the Infinitely Low Earth</h4>
	During the night of the new moon, Yukari asks Ran to think about why the Moon is rarely at its fullest during 15th night of its orbital period, despite the orbital period being 30 days. Three days later during the cresent moon, the pair notice Remilia's rocket launch in the sky. Ran asks Yukari why she deliberately set things up for Remilia to go to the Moon despite never explicitly expressing this intention, to which Yukari's response is that a bullet-shaped rocket was always meant for a sword-shaped moon. Incidentally, Ran arrives at an answer to Yukari's puzzle: someone must have tampered with the Moon's rotational period, which affected its orbital period and rendered it shorter than 28 days. On the night before the full moon, Ran expresses doubt about Yukari's plan to infiltrate the Moon, since her last attempt failed despite having a much bigger army then. Yukari reassures her than there is no chance that creatures from Earth will ever be able to defeat the people of the Moon, and that her mission is merely to collect a "residential tax" for Gensokyo's newly arrived residents from the Moon (namely, the Eientei crew). Since Gensokyo's existence is preserved by the balance between humans and youkai, the Lunarians' existence as neither human nor youkai is a disturbance, despite the crew's best efforts to integrate as humans. Yukari wants Ran to sneak into Lunar society to collect the tax. On the night of the full moon, Yukari opens a portal to the Moon using its reflection on the lake. Upon the pair's arrival at the Moon, Yukari talks about the hypothetical situation of a youkai trying to invade the Lunar Capital in exactly the same manner, but becoming unable to return to Earth due to the portal closing sooner than expected thanks to the altered orbital period, and being forced to surrender. The tampering of the orbital period is, therefore, the laying of a trap. Ran asks Yukari about their current situation being precarious, since it is playing out exactly like the hypothetical scenario, but Yukari feigns surprise.

	<h4>Ch 6: The Fool’s Sealed Letter</h4>
	Reisen (not Udonge) watches as Marisa battles Yorihime on the Moon. She reminisces of the old days when pounding mochi alongside other rabbits was her daily routine, bringing light to the fact that they were actually making the Hourai Elixir under the guise of mochi-pounding. Oblivious, the rabbits were told that the mochi-pounding was for the atonement of Lady Chang'e's sins. Feeling disillusioned with her job, Reisen had fled to the Earth 3 months ago. Before doing so, she had heard rumors of a Lunar invasion, which were set off by someone (later known to be Reimu) calling upon the Sumiyoshi Sanjin gods. Upon returning to the Moon, Reisen was made to join the lunar emissaries. As ordered by Yorihime, Reisen goes to Yorihime's mansion and writes a letter to Eirin to update her on events. Reisen realizes that the dynamic between humans and youkai was more complicated than as depicted by Lunarians, and would gladly entrust herself to someone like Reimu. While on her way to deliver the letter to Eirin, Reisen finds herself at an unknown location and bumps into Toyohime, who seems to be waiting to witness something about to happen from the sidelines.

	<h4>Ch 7: Half-body Half-loyalty</h4>
	The previous summer, Yukari had visited Yuyuko and Youmu at their garden to request them to monitor Remilia's actions, as the vampire was likely to go to the Moon. Yuyuko declined the request. Determined to not be relegated to a position of just asking questions, Youmu decided to look into Remilia's affairs on her own. At the Scarlet Devil Mansion's library, Youmu was caught spying on the rocket's construction progress by Patchouli, but was then treated as a guest. At the moment, Patchouli seems unsure of how to power the rocket. Later, Youmu tailed Sakuya on her errand to do research on that front, and was discovered again. Youmu visits Kourindou to find out what Sakuya had been purchasing, and was told that the store had several books on the Apollo program, which were now out of stock. Youmu was given a book about the Soyuz rocket instead and from it, deduces that the Scarlet Devil Mansion crew had based their rocket off those of the Outside. Youmu confesses to monitoring the rocket crew on her own and divulges her findings, to which Yuyuko subtly hints that Reimu should be made to get involved somehow. In the present, Youmu and Yuyuko have arrived on the Moon through Yukari's portal crafted from the Moon's reflection on the lake.

	<h4>Last Ch: Two Kinds of Homesickness</h4>
	On the Moon, the Watatsuki sisters make a captive Reimu publicly prove her ability to summon the gods. The three of them later discuss the various methods of transportation between the Earth and the Moon. They tease out of Reimu the fact that Yukari was the one who instigated Reimu's training in the beginning. Yuyuko and Youmu, having sneaked onto the Moon, notice the captive Reimu. At Gensokyo, the rest of the rocket crew still awaited Reimu's return. Remilia had ordered that a recreation of a sea and beach be built in her mansion's library, having planned to invite Reimu to enjoy this Moon-inspired luxury upon her return. Reimu finally returns and joins the crew at the library. Yukari, Ran, Yuyuko, and Youmu join in with a bottle of sake stolen from the Watatsukis. Eirin and Kaguya appear. Drinking the sake, Eirin interprets Yukari's intentions to be inflicting a special kind of terror upon the Lunarians.

	<h3>Touhou Sangetsusei: Oriental Sacred Place</h3>
	<h4>Ch 7-8: The Boletes and the Slug</h4>
	The fairies come across a patch of penny buns while mushroom hunting. Despite Marisa's suspicions, as there are so many of them and they are out of season, the fairies consume some of them. The next morning, Sunny and Star are extremely energized while Luna is still her usual self. Upon going back to the site, they discover that the mushrooms are all gone. At the shrine, Marisa discusses the mushroom patch with Reimu and recounts the story of the three-way deadlock (between the snake, the frog, and the slug). The mushroom patch is the result of the slug melting the snake into froth, from which mushrooms grow and are then eaten by the slug. The mushrooms produced this way take on the qualities of the snake, whatever they may be, and therein lies the risk of consuming them. Upon hearing this, the fairies set out the next day to find a snake to make more mushrooms from.

Suddenly, the building appears in the distance, and Reimu takes off in its direction, only for the building to vanish. At the shrine, Aya explains to Marisa that Gensokyo, once being entirely underwater, harbors a particular youkai clam buried in the ground that can breathe out mist that shows others illusions. Such illusions are known as nagafu. Reimu returns with the fairies, announcing that she will hunt down the youkai responsible for the floating city's "disappearance." Both Aya and Marisa play to Reimu's whims without informing her of the illusion.
